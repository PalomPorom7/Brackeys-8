# Brackeys-8

This project was completed during the Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2 from August 21st to 28th.
The theme for the jam was "You're Not Alone".

Tiggle and Woggle were created by imagining how characters who were tall and wide could interact with their environment in different ways.
Following the jam theme, I added the functionality of making the characters toggle and wiggle.
Due to time constraints of the jam, work and life obligations made it impossible to implement many of the imagined features.

Built in Unity Version 2020.3.37f1
